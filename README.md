Greetings fellow Scouters,  

I'm a participant in the BSA Wood Badge adult training program (class of N2-404-17). You can read more about the program and its benefits here: https://www.scouting.org/training/adult/woodbadge/.  

Each participant of this program is responsible to come up with a set of 5 goals to improve their unit within 18 months of completing the course. These 5 goals are called a "Ticket" and the vision statement for mine is as follows:  

"Enhance the availability of the STEM program within my unit and encourage other counselors outside my unit to offer STEM-Based workshops."
  
One of my five goals that works towards this vision statement is making the resources i've used to hold workshops for the Programming and Electronics Merit Badges publicly available for others to leverage off and improve upon. Hence, making it easier for adults that might have considered becoming a Merit Badge Counselor and offering a similar workshop but lacking the time to gather resources and plan out a curriculum. 
  
Anyway, the slides I used for these Merit Badge Workshops are located here (view only):

Pay close attention to the notes associated to each slide. There are also additional links in the documents for more shared resources.

Please feel free to contact me regarding any questions or improvements that can be made. Feedback is a gift. 

Enjoy.

Yours In the Spirit of Wood Badge
