## Greetings fellow Scouters

## Encouraging More STEM-Based Merit Badge Counselors

Each participant of the Wood Badge program is responsible to come up with a set of 5 goals to improve their unit within 18 months of completing the course. These 5 goals are called a "Ticket" and the vision statement for mine is as follows:  

>Enhance the availability of the STEM program within my unit and encourage other counselors outside my unit to offer STEM-Based workshops.

One of my five goals that works towards this vision statement is making the resources i've used to hold workshops for the Programming and Electronics Merit Badges publicly available for others to leverage off and improve upon. Hence, making it easier for adults that might have considered becoming a Merit Badge Counselor and offering a similar workshop but lacking the time to gather resources and plan out a curriculum.

## How To Use This Project

* Links to the view-only Googe Slides are provided in the next section. Pdf's were generated from these and might be easier to read intially. The pdf's are located in this repository under the corresponding Merit Badge directory.

* Pay close attention to the notes associated with each slide. There are also additional links in the documents for more shared resources. The resources are available on both Google Drive and also located in this repository under the appropriate directory. Resources will include sample programs, worksheets, feedback forms, attendance sheets, etc...

* Read through the slides and get a sense of the specifics such as the chosen circuits and sample programs. These may or may not suite your needs and can be replaced accordingly by making your own copy of the presentation.

* Details about the length of time it will take to complete each Workshop are all located within the slide notes.
